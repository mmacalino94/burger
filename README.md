# Eat-Da-Burger!

This assignment focuses on creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an homemade ORM. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that will let the user input the names of the burgers that they would like to eat. 

When a burger name is submitted the app will display the burger and it will wait for it to be eaten and attached next to it will be a "Devour it!" button. Once the button is clicked the burger will move to the devoured side.
